What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?
It was a good assignment - I just wish I hadn't waited until Tuesday
to complete it because it meant I didn't have enough time to do the
challenge part.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?
I used global variables to keep track of line numbers.
